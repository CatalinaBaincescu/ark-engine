ARK-ENGINE
===========

ARK-ENGINE is an enhanced chatbot engine developed using the AIML 2.0 compliant program-ab. The idea is to understand it, simplify it and enhance some of its features.

**OPTIMIZED FOR NETBEANS**

Wanted Features
========

1. **MULTILINGUAL**. To be able to work with multiple languages.
2. **KNOWLEDGE BASED**. It will be oriented to webmining.
3. **SMART**. It will save user related information in short time memory, learn from websearches, include sentiment analysis, and other features.

Installation
============

1. Download the source and open it in your favorite Java IDE (Netbeans is recommended).
2. Open the default.properties file and edit properties as you consider needed ex. local filesystem paths.
3. You can run the test suite.
4. 

TO_DO
=====

Still a lot to do, this is pretty much the same program-ab original version. I will focus on simplifying it and enhancing some of its features in order to make it compatible with Iris.
